# GLSL-Sandbox wave animation
The default animation in [shader editor](https://github.com/mrdoob/glsl-sandbox) by [mrdoob](https://github.com/mrdoob) piqued my curiosity. Here I attempt to figure out the math and code architecture, in order to further tailor it to my liking. Potentially, I may use this as the background for one of my webpages.

### See a live demo [here](https://jiramehr.github.io/tweaking-glsl-sandbox/static/website.html).
