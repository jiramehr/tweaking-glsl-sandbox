                    the viewport one can increase the cooefficient that multiplies by either dimension aka <em>the wave number</em>. However, since
                    in the default code the wave number is oscillating it will go to zero and and change sign over a finite period of time determined 
                    by the coefficeint multiplied by the time. This effect hugely dimineshes the calming characteristics of the original visualization
                    and needs to be addressed as I am interested in shoerter wavelengths.</li>
