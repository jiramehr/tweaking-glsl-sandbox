However, since in the default code that coeefficient is oscillating it will go to zero and and change sign over a finite period of time determined by the coefficeint multiplied by the time. This effect hugely dimineshes the calming characteristics of the original visualization and needs to be addresses as I am be interested in shoerter wavelengths.</li>
